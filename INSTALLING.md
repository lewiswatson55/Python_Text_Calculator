# Installing Palc
To use Palc, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.x [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).** Click **Download Python 3.X.X** and  then follow the instructions.  
2. **Install the latest version of Palc :** Go [here](https://github.com/TheTechRobo/python-text-calculator/archive/master.zip) and extract the ZIP.
3. **Go into a terminal**. For mac users: Click the magnifying glass in the top-right corner of the screen and type **Terminal**. When you see a word that says "Terminal" and an icon that looks like a black screen with a few lines, press ENTER.
4. **When the terminal is open :** type `cd Downloads/python-text-calculator-master` and then `python3 palc.py`. After you do that, Palc starts to run!
